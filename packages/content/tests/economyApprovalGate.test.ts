/**
 * Economy levers are approval-gated (CLAUDE.md directive 22): every value in
 * economy.json and every mission payout is game design the maintainer owns
 * personally. These pins make a lever movement impossible to land silently:
 * any change turns the suite red until this file is re-pinned, and the
 * re-pin belongs in the same change as the recorded approval of the specific
 * lever and value (sprint doc or economy-bible amendment log).
 *
 * Re-pinned for the labour and fitting retune (`energy.energyPerGradeByTier`
 * renamed to `energy.energyPerBandStepByToolTier`, 10/6/4 -> 5/4/3;
 * `energy.energyByClass["bolt-on"]` 10 -> 3; `energy.energyByClass.buried`
 * 20 -> 6) signed in `docs/design/workshop-rework.md`, Labour (signed
 * 2026-07-23).
 *
 * Re-pinned 2026-07-23 (maintainer order, in session): `four-wheels`
 * payout/budget 145000 -> 130000, restoring the tutorial's designed margin
 * after the daily machine hire removed one 15000-yen engine fee from the
 * taught build ("keep the margin as it was, reduce Yuki's payment amount").
 *
 * Re-pinned 2026-07-23 (maintainer choice, in session): `the-showroom-standard`
 * payout/budget 1200000 -> 1231000. The body-zone rework retired the sport
 * body-part grades the original 1200000 was formula-derived from; the honest
 * replacement build re-derives to 1231000, and the maintainer chose to bump
 * the payout to match rather than let the mission drift off-formula.
 *
 * Re-pinned for the body-model generation levers signed in the Sprint 119
 * lever table (`docs/sprints/sprint119.md`, "The complete lever table"): L3
 * added `partsGeneration.zoneStates` (per-tier metal/finish severity weight
 * tables, the chassis metal table one row kinder per tier, and
 * `surfaceExtraChance` 0.2) exactly as that table states.
 *
 * Re-pinned for the L5 SKU-disposition lever in the same table:
 * `missingSlotWeightByPart.panels`/`.paint`/`.underbody` 1 -> 0 - those
 * three parts are derived from zone state now, so they never roll missing
 * as a whole slot; only the `aero` kit slot still can, weight unchanged at
 * 3, exactly as the table states.
 *
 * Re-pinned for the grip-driven handling model (Sprint 123, maintainer-confirmed
 * 2026-07-24): `statFormulas.handlingBase`/`handlingWeightDivisor` removed and a
 * new `statFormulas.grip` block added (era rubber table, tier deltas incl. the
 * provisional `slick: 0.20`, grade-to-compound map, width/transfer/layout/track
 * constants, the two-segment display curve, and the balance term). Handling now
 * derives from mechanical grip rather than weight.
 *
 * Re-pinned 2026-07-24 (maintainer approval, in session): the grip display
 * curve's `statFormulas.grip.displayCurve.modifiedHighG` 2.0 -> 1.62, so a
 * full-slick race build (mechanical mu ~1.51, per the Calsonic BNR32 Gr.A
 * telemetry) reads ~90 on the 0-100 handling stat instead of ~76. No current
 * (stock) car exceeds mu 1.10, so no displayed stat or payout moves; this only
 * sets the future modified-grip ceiling. Signed in docs/design/lap-calibration.md.
